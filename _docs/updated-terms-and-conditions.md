description: MockLab Terms of Service to become effective on the 12th of October 2020
---

Welcome to MockLab. Please read these terms carefully before you submit to us your order for a subscription or free trial to use the MockLab service.

These Terms of Service set out the terms of a contract between us and our customers. They describe the MockLab service we will provide to you, how we will work together, and other aspects of our business relationship. We cannot provide the MockLab service to you unless you agree to them. We are MockLab Ltd, a limited company registered in England and Wales under company number 11495051. We are referred to as "we", "us" or "MockLab" in these Terms of Service. "You" means the person or entity requesting access to the MockLab service.

Your attention is drawn in particular to the ability for us to suspend your access to the Services under section 1.6; section 3.1, which sets out important disclaimers in respect of how the Services operate; and the limits of liability in section 12.

If you think that there is a mistake in these terms or they require any changes, or you would like to discuss any of them, please contact us a [info@mocklab.io](mailto:info@mocklab.io).

You agree to these Terms of Service on behalf of the entity or organisation whose details you enter on the MockLab website as subscribing to or evaluating the MockLab service. By doing so, you are representing to us that you have the authority to do so.

The binding contract created by your acceptance of these Terms of Service and our acceptance of your order for a subscription is referred to in these Terms of Service as "our agreement". If you breach of any of the terms, we may terminate your access to the Services.

If they’re not given a meaning right away when they are mentioned, capitalised terms (like "the Services", for example) are defined at the end of these Terms of Service in section 15.
