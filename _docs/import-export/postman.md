Postman is one of the most widely used tools for testing HTTP services, and its
collection format has become a de-facto standard for representing request and response examples.

MockLab can import your Postman collection and convert it into a collection of stubs.

Postman files are imported in exactly the same way as other formats.
See [Import and Export Overview](/docs/import-and-export/) for basic importing instructions via the UI and
[Importing and Export via the API](/docs/import-export/api) for directions on automating
imports via MockLab's API.
